game and exploratory vector-learnin' experience
being chiefly for coding and mathematics activities at the ASMS 2014

featuring contributions from TJM and CH



### Intended user-adjusted parameters and interface stuff

*NB it's also intended that the user modify the code itself, but maybe a standalone version with run-time controls is also warranted...*

#### Gates
* number of gates
* vertical width of each gate
* horizontal width of each gate?
* spacing between gates

#### Player
* size
* boost components (acceleration vector)
* when to apply the acceleration (time and space?)

#### General Environment
* gravity
* atmospheric drag
* visibility of collision model
* visibility of coordinate axes
* visibility of vectors
* paths of previous attempts with 'boost' points highlighted
* visualisation of the boost vector


#### Other Things
* facility for screen capture
* facility for saving parameters between sessions
* cheap and neat vectored particle effects implying rocketry
